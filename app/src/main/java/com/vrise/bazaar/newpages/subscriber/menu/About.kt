//        textView192.text = "As a new and cutting-edge android web application from IBR Solutions, IBR Bazaar is a one-shot solution for the long and tedious task of newspaper and magazine payments. IBR Bazaar offers a singular payment portal where everyone can pay for what they subscribe and read. The new societal thrust for information has created a frenzied need for knowledge from every minute sector of life.\n\n" +
//                "Earlier our options were limited when talking about free and desired access for books and newspapers. The tedious and often cumbersome task of managing subscriptions, paying bills etc. took a lot of time and energy, both for subscribers and agents. The introduction of IBR Bazaar has finally given us an option to digitalize the reading world and make the process easier. Now we can enjoy the newspapers and magazines of our choice, number and language and pay for them, all from the comforts of the home.\n\n" +
//                "Here is how it works:\n" +
//                "The user can sign up and create a profile either as a normal client or agent. The customer can search for, browse through and subscribe to his favourite newspapers, books and magazines in his preferred languages. The agents can register themselves and add bank details like the branch and IFSC code. Each agent gets a code after successful registration.\n" +
//                "Now the agent dashboard does a variety of functions. The agents can add routes and add clients to the route. They can view the client list and route list, create a user ID for their clients and add/remove clients from their dashboard. There is an option to view the list of clients who are due on payment. Details like client subscription list, due date and client profile can be viewed and printed. There is also an option for directly calling the client.\n" +
//                "The app provides space for displaying ads, user details, invoices and payment option in the home page. The client can select from a whole array of categories of newspapers, magazines and books in different languages. Payment can be done through the payment page.\n\n" +
//                "Key features\n" +
//                "• The client can view the monthly wise bills in the bill page\n" +
//                "• A reminder for agents of clients due date can send in the form of notifications\n" +
//                "• A client list can be generated on the basis of routes.\n" +
//                "• Real-time notifications can be sent to the user\n" +
//                "• The admin can view and add reconciliation of payments received, payments processed and payments received and can create daily reports accordingly.\n" +
//                "• The admin can manage marketing employees and generate code for each employee."
